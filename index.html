      If someone sent you to this page, it's probably because they are
      urging you not to put them through this capricious interview practice. Or
      they're explaining why they've already refused. I hope it's the latter.

      There's plentiful research explaining
      why and how live coding challenges fail to serve any useful purpose.
      Live coding challenges are high pressure social performances that strip a
      candidate of all the tools, context, and support they would rely on to do
      real work. People's performance is a product of their environment, and live
      coding challenges are just about as unlike a real software development
      environment as it's possible to get. Doing these challenges on a whiteboard
      is worse than other methods, but screen sharing and pair programming tools
      have the same problems.

        Researchers at North Carolina State University in 2020
      </a>
      clearly demonstrated that live white board interviews don't work. In fact,
      the actual effect of these challenges is to eliminate a great deal of
      capable and qualified candidates.

      [...] the software industry has seemingly reinvented
      a crude yet effective instrument for reliably introducing stress in
      subjects, which typically manifests as performance anxiety. A
      technical interview has an uncanny resemblance to the trier social
      stress test, a procedure used for decades by psychologists and
      is the best known “gold standard” procedure for the sole purpose of
      reliably inducing stress.

      Notably, those researchers found that zero of the women in the test
      passed the challenge when they were required to perform live for an
      audience. Every woman tested passed when they were allowed to work
      privately.
